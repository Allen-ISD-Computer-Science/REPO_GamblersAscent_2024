# Gamblers-Ascent
Embark on a thrilling journey into the heart of the GambleQuest Dungeon Tower, where risk and reward collide in an epic adventure! In this unique gambling-themed game, you'll step into a world where fortune favors the brave, and the stakes have never been higher.

# Vision Statement

The goal of this project is to create a C++ Game that is not only fun, but informative to those who play and serves as a reminder that the house always wins, and the best throw of dice is to throw them away. By taking advantage of our skills and knowledge of what we're capable of, we plan to make this a long-term offical releaase, with a demo release Q1 2024 and 1.0 avaliable in May.
